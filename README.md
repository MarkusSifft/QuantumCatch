# QuantumPolyspectra: a Python Package for the Analysis and Simulation of Quantum Measurements 
by M. Sifft and D. HÃ¤gele

The QuantumPolyspectra package is open-source software for analyzing and simulating quantum measurements in terms of socalled quantum polysectra. The simulation of measurement traces (integration of the stochastic master equation) is implemented via the QuTiP toolbox whereas the calculation of polyspectra from Hamiltonians or measurements traces recorded in the lab is performed as described in [this paper](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.98.205143)

## Support
The development of the QuantumPolyspectra package is supported by the working group Spectroscopy of Condensed Matter of the Faculty of Physics and Astronomy at the Ruhr University Bochum.

## Documentation
Examples for every function of the package are currently added to the folder Examples
