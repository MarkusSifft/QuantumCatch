# QuantumPolyspectra: a Python Package for the Analysis and Simulation of Quantum Measurements 
by M. Sifft and D. HÃ¤gele

The QuantumPolyspectra package is open-source software for analyzing and simulating quantum measurements in terms of socalled quantum polysectra. Here we refere to the polysectra as as second to fourth order spectra (powerspectrum, bispectrum, and trispectrum). The simulation of measurement traces (integration of the stochastic master equation) is implemented via the QuTiP toolbox whereas the calculation of polyspectra from Hamiltonians or measurements traces recorded in the lab is performed as described in [this paper](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.98.205143) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07992) which also shows the utilization of quantum polyspectra to extract Hamiltonian paramers from a quantum measurement. 

## Documentation
The package is devided into two parts: the **generate** module and the **analyze** module. 
### Generate Module
This module connects any measurement trace as defined by a timeindependet stochastic master equation with its corresponding polyspectra. Notice that spectra can be inferred via an actually simulation of the measurement trace by intergration of the SME or (much quicker) by directly evaluating the ???formulas as shown [here](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.98.205143). 
### Analyze Module
This module allows for a convient calculation of ployspectra from any measurement performed in the laboratory using state of the art cumulant estimators and window function. Error estimation is done automatically. All routines are implemented using the Arrayfire library which allows the code to run on any CPU and GPU (Nvidia and AMD). GPU are highly recommened for measurement trace exceeding 3 GB (binary size, not as .csv). The module also comes with a helper function for the conversion between .csv files to .h5 files which are needed to run the routines.

### Examples
Examples for every function of the package are currently added to the folder Examples
